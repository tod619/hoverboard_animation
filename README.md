# hoverboard_animation

## Description

An example of a hover animation that is added and removed using JavaScript. A board is created in the script.js file. When the user hovers the mouse over the squares on the board they light up with a random color. Whe the mouse leaves the square slowly returns to the original color. As the user moves the mouse across the board a trail of random colors is created by the users mouse movement.
